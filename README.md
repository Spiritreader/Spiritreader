### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student working on various projects.
Mostly interested in building multi-part applications that use separate backend and frontend infrastructures.

### Current Main Project
I'm working together with [@Armin2208](https://github.com/Armin2208) on a software called Auto Dark Mode for Windows. It handles switching your windows theme for you automatically!

My favorite languages include:
- Golang
- C#
- Python

My favorite webframeworks:
- Nuxt/Vue.js
- Vanilla (heh)
