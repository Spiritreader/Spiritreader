### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student working on various projects.
Mostly interested in building multi-part applications that use separate backend and frontend infrastructures.

### Auto Dark Mode
I'm working together with [@Armin2208](https://github.com/Armin2208) on Auto Dark Mode for Windows. It handles switching your windows theme for you automatically!
[Please check it out here!](https://github.com/AutoDarkMode/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode)

### Walzen Group
Together with [@FunnyPocketBook](https://github.com/FunnyPocketBook) I run [Walzen](https://github.com/Walzen-Group), a home server hobby project that has gone way out of scope and has turned into a compsci/sysadmin passion project.
We're mostly making tools to manage our stack, but most of it is FOSS and when we get the chance we try to contribute to the projects we use and like.

### Languages

My favorite languages include:
- C#
- Golang
- Python
- JS/TS

My favorite web frameworks:
- Vue.js with Vuetify
- Vanilla (heh)

Learning:
- rust
